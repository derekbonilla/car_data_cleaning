### Real-world situation

You are working with a local used car dealership. The dealership owner wants to know which cars customers are most likely to purchase so that they know what to keep in stock. From an external source, you obtain a data set that contains historical sales data on car prices and their related features: CarPrice_Assignment. You think these features can be used to give the dealership owner a list of the top popular cars and trims, and help determine which cars should be in the inventory.

The goal of this project is to clean the data. Analyzing bad data could cause the business owner to reach the wrong conclusions and, ultimately, lose money.

## Inspect the data

According to the data description, should contain only two unique string values: diesel and gas. For this reason, this column should be inspected by checking its unique values. 

```javascript
SELECT 
  DISTINCT (fueltype)
FROM 
  public.car_data
```

<img src="images/gas diesel result.png"/>

Since these values agree with the values in the data description, I can verify that the data in the fueltype column is already clean.

According to the data description, the length column values should range from 141.1 to 208.1. I will make the following query containing the MIN() and MAX() functions to inspect the minimum and maximum values of this column:

```javascript
SELECT 
  MIN(carlength) AS min_length,
  MAX(carlength) AS max_length
FROM public.car_data
```
<img src="images/min max length.png">

Again the results in this column is clean.

### Fill in missing data

Missing values in data can distort analysis results. One way to inspect a column for missing values in SQL is to use the IS NULL condition.

```javascript
SELECT * 
FROM public.car_data
WHERE doornumber IS null;
```

<img src="images/null doors.png">

The number of doors is only missing for one BMW and one Honda with sedan body styles. Also, the fuel type equals gas for the both BMW and the Honda

Make a query to pull up BMW with matching attributes:

```javascript
SELECT*
FROM 
  public.car_data
WHERE 
  carname LIKE 'bmw%' 
  AND fueltype = 'gas'
  AND aspiration = 'std'
  AND carbody = 'sedan'
ORDER BY 1;
```

<img src="images/bmw null.png">

I notice that there is also another BMW 320i with similar features. However, after doing additional research I can safely conclude that the missing value here should be four. 

To make the replacement, make the following query using the UPDATE statement:

```javascript
UPDATE 
  public.car_data
SET
  doornumber = 'four'
WHERE
  "car_ID" = '12'
```

To verify that the missing value was filled in correctly, I made the same query previously and the results appeared like this:

<img src="images/bmw fixed null .png">

Now I repeat the same process for the Honda.

## Identify potential mistakes in the data

Using the DISTINCT statement I check for erroneous data that can distort results.

```javascript 
SELECT
  DISTINCT(cylindernumber)
FROM
  public.car_data;
```

<img src="images/distinct cylinder number .png">

I find that there are written values of numbers, and one of those number values is misspelled. 

Using a similar used above I fix the misspelled value. Result looks like this:

<img src="images/distinct cylinder number fixed .png">

Cylinder number column is now clean.


Some values include numbers in a range. I make a query to inspect the peakrpm column

```javascript
SELECT 
  MIN(peakrpm) AS min_peakrpm, 
  MAX(peakrpm) AS max_peakrpm
FROM public.car_data
```
Results look like this:

<img src="images/minmax peakrpm .png">

Sometimes values can be out of range. According to the data description, the peakrpm column values should range from 4150 to 6600.

I will make a query to see if other values in this column are in range
```javascript

SELECT 
  peakrpm
FROM 
  public.car_data
ORDER BY 
 peakrpm ASC;
```

Results are in range.

To gain more insight I query:

```javascript
SELECT
  *
FROM
  cars.car_info
WHERE
 peakrpm = 520;
```

<img src="images/peakrpm error.png">

One result is returned. After doing additional research I can conclude that the correct number should be 5200. In SQL I will use the UPDATE statement fix the existing record in a table.

```javascript
SELECT 
  peakrpm
FROM 
  public.car_data
ORDER BY 
 peakrpm ASC;

```

I recheck to see if the erroneous value was fixed correctly. The peakrpm column should be clean.


## Ensuring that the data is consistent

Discrepancies can create inaccurate, unreliable results. This leads to misinformed business decisions.

I will use the DISTINCT statement to check for data inconsistencies in enginelocation

<img src="images/enginelocation.png">

These values appear to agree. However, front appears twice. This is most likely happening because some front values include extra spaces. I will use the LENGTH function to understand this:

```javascript
SELECT  
  LENGTH (enginelocation) AS length_enginelocation
FROM 
  public.car_data
GROUP BY 
  enginelocation;
```

The SQL LENGTH function identified an inconsistent point, front had 6 characters when there should only be 5. TO fix this I remove the leading space from this string. I will use the TRIM function to remove the space.

```javascript
UPDATE 
  public.car_data
SET
  enginelocation = TRIM (enginelocation)
WHERE 
  LENGTH (enginelocation) > 5;

```


I verify if the space was removed with a query and get these results

<img src="images/enginelocation fixed.png">

Now this column is clean.


## Conclusion

Working with clean data will insure that investors make good decisions about their stock.
